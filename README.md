# BDC-Hack
This project is designed to better connect spotify users with mutual friends and give musical ID to each user. Using Spotify, msuixmatch, and IBM Watson's Personality Insights API, this project leads the user to get a personality fingerprint based on the music they listen to as well as being able to view how well they match with their friends.
